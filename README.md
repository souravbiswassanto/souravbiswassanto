<small>April 2023 – Present</small>

- **Kubernetes Operator & Controller Development:**  
  - Extended Kubernetes via CRDs and custom controllers (Go) to automate PostgreSQL and Oracle cluster orchestration, achieving **99.999% high availability** in Kubernetes environments.  
  - Implemented autoscaling, self-healing, and automated failover to avoid downtime and ensure **99.99999% data safety**, reducing manual failover interventions by **90%**.  
- **Observability & Monitoring:**  
  - Co-developed a Prometheus generic metrics exporter and crafted Grafana dashboards for real-time insights on PostgreSQL performance, resulting in a **99% reduction in production outages**.  
- **CI/CD & Automation:**  
  - Built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for Managed PostgreSQL on Kubernetes. Automated builds, tests, Docker image creation, and deployments—cutting manual steps by **80%** and accelerating release cycles by **30%**.  
- **Distributed Systems & Storage:**  
  - Leveraged consistent hashing algorithms and the Kubernetes Operator pattern to distribute workloads evenly among registered controllers, ensuring efficient resource utilization in a distributed system.  
  - Added support for Amazon S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, and NFS for PITR and cron backups.  
- **Release Management:**  
  - Led the release of **[KubeDB v2024.8.21](https://appscode.com/blog/post/kubedb-v2024.8.21/)**, introducing a stable **v1 API** for the `kubedb.com` resource group and managing backward-compatible conversions from `v1alpha2` to `v1`.
  - Managed various KubeDB release including **[KubeDB V2025.2.19](https://appscode.com/blog/post/kubedb-v2025.2.19/)**, **[KubeDB V2025.3.24](https://appscode.com/blog/post/kubedb-v2025.3.24/)**.
